		<h1>Animal Trip Quiz</h1>
		<p>In a small village, there are three people: a baker, a butcher and a candlestick maker.</p>
		<p>Each person has a pet: the baker has a cat, the butcher has a dog and the candlestick maker has a bird.</p>
		<p>One day the Easter Bunny was hopping through town and they all decided to go on a trip together, each bringing along their pet.</p>
		<p>Along the way, they passed through four towns.</p>
		<p>In the first town, they met a man with two cats.</p>
		<p>In the second town, they met a woman with three dogs.</p>
		<p>In the third town, they met a child with four birds.</p>
		<p>And in the fourth town, they met a farmer with a cat, a dog, and a bird.</p>
